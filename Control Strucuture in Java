OVERVIEW
In the most basic sense, a program is a list of instructions. Control structures are programming blocks that can change the path we take through those instructions.
There are three kinds of control structures:

Conditional Branches, which we use for choosing between two or more paths. There are three types in Java: if/else/else if, ternary operator and switch.
Loops that are used to iterate through multiple values/objects and repeatedly run specific code blocks. The basic loop types in Java are for, while and do while.
Branching Statements, which are used to alter the flow of control in loops. There are two types in Java: break and continue.

IF/ELSE/ELSE IF
Theoretically, we can infinitely chain or nest if/else blocks but this will hurt code readability, and that’s why it’s not advised.

TERNARY OPERATOR
System.out.println((a > 0) ? "Positive" : "Zero or Negative");

We can use a ternary operator as a shorthand expression that works like an if/else statement.

SWITCH
int count = 3;
switch (count) {
    case 0:
        System.out.println("Count is equal to 0");
        break;
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Count is equal to 1");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Count is either negative, or higher than 1");
        break;
}
Three or more if/else statements can be hard to read. As one of the possible workarounds, we can use switch, as seen above.

Do not forget to put 'break', if you want to make your code run for only one specific condition.

LOOPS
We use loops when we need to repeat the same code multiple times in succession.

BREAK
We need to use break to exit early from a loop.

CONTINUE
Simply put, continue means to skip the rest of the loop we’re in
